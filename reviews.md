      "Reassuring and Effective. A really effective way of ensuring that people know of your health risk when you are least able to tell them. Easy to set up and functions faultlessly. At the end of my trial I will be buying the paid-for version, as the developer really deserves to be rewarded. Thanks"

      "The ONLY ICE app can be read on a locked phone. This is the ONLY ICE app I've found which can be read by EMTs and other First Responders when you are unconscious or confused. The ad says that US measurement is available, but I don't see how on the free version. I'm using Marshmallow 6.0."
