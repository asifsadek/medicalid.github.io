      <h4 id="differences_free_premium">Q1: What are the differences between the free and the premium version?</h4>
      <p class="faq-answer">
      The main purpose of the app is to help people and ultimately save lives. Although the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.medicalid.free" title="Medical ID (free)">free version</a> includes all the basics to reach this goal, developing and maintaining such an app has a cost. The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.medicalid" title="Medical ID (premium)">premium version</a> gives you access to more features (e.g. customizing lock screen widget, backing up your medical information, creating multiple profiles, etc.) but also allows us to maintain and update the app regularly.

      <h4 id="editing_profile">Q2: How to edit a profile?</h4>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Editing a profile requires opening the app from the app launcher (i.e. not the lock screen). Once done, a list of cards is displayed: one per existing profile. Identify the card associated with the profile you want to modify, then tap on the "Edit" button. This action opens the profile you have selected for edition. Make your changes and validate by clicking on the top right side <em>tick</em> icon.

      <h4 id="defining_ice_contacts">Q3: How to define ICE contacts?</h4>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        The app allows creating profiles. Each profile contains a <em>Medical Notes</em> section. In this section, you can write the first letters of one of your device contacts. When such action is done, a pop-up appears to select the right contact. Upon selection, a link is automatically created. This way, when the profile is displayed on the lock screen, anybody can tap the link to open the profile associated with the contact you have defined and call him without unlocking your device.

      <h4 id="preventing_lockscreen_widget_disappearing">Q4: The lock screen floating icon disappears after some time</h4>
      <p>Medical ID unfortunately has no control over this - Android disable it on some devices and we cannot prevent this. However, on most devices, you can fix it by disabling app optimization for Medical ID in Settings to stop Android from switching off the accessibility service that runs the lock screen floating icon. This is usually found in Settings > Battery.
</p>

<p>For example on the Samsung S8, go to Android Settings > General > Battery > look under App Optimization and select Details. Then find Medical ID and turn it off.</p>

<p>On other devices, you may have to specify that Medical ID should be ignored in battery optimization. For example, on Huawei phones, go to Settings > Apps > Advanced Options > Ignore Optimations and toggle "allow" for Medical ID.</p>

<p>If Medical ID is running on an SD card (external storage), that means it's "unavailable" when the system boots. This can turn off the accessibility service that is required to show the floating icon on your lock screen. Try moving it back to main storage.</p>

<p>In all cases, we recommend checking that Medical ID Accessibility Service is on.</p>

      <h4 id="editing_default_alert_message">Q5: How to edit the default SMS alert message?</h4>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Open the app, tap on the top right 3 dots button, select <strong>Settings</strong> then <strong>Alerts</strong>. At this stage, you should find a section called <strong>SMS alert message</strong>. Tap on it, set the message you want and confirm with <em>OK</em>.

        Please note that your message may contain what we call <strong>placeholders</strong>. Placeholders are replaced automatically by their corresponding value just before the message is sent.

        There exist 4 placeholders:

        <ul>
          <li><strong>$firstname</strong> is replaced by the first name set on your top profile.</li>
          <li><strong>$lastname</strong> is replaced by the last name set on your top profile.</li>
          <li><strong>$address</strong> is replaced by the best-estimated address it was possible to find.</li>
          <li><strong>$coordinates_link</strong> is replaced by the estimated GPS location along with a link to display your location on Google map. Obviously, if location acquisition was possible.</li>
        </ul>

      <h4 id="android_o">Q6: Medical ID behaves differently since Android 8.0 Oreo?</h4>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Android 8.0 Oreo includes a variety of system changes. It is no longer allowed to display a floating icon on the lock screen. If you were using this feature, now it falls back to the notification. Also you may have noticed a persistent "X is running in the background" or "apps are running in the background" notifications. The purpose of these notifications is to highlight users about apps that are consuming battery in the background. This is a highly controversial new feature of Android 8.0 Oreo since there is no built-in option to whitelist apps which are OK. Hopefully, a third-party app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.rubber.remove.is.running.in.the.background.notification" title="Remove boring Android 8.0 'running in the background' notifications">Rubber</a> allows erasing such boring notifications. We recommend to use it if you want to get rid of them.
