      <h4>Q1: What are the differences between the free and premium version?</h4>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        The main purpose of the app is to help people and ultimately save lifes. Although the free version includes all basics to reach this goal, developing an maintaining such an app has a cost. The premium version help us to continue the development of the app but also gives you access to more features (e.g. creating multiple profiles, customising widgets, etc.).

      <h4>Q2: How can I edit a profile?</h4>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Open the app from the app launcher (i.e. not the lock screen). At this stage you should see a list of cards:  one per existing profile. Tap on the card associated with the profile to edit, for instance the image profile.

      <h4>Q3: How can I define ICE contacts?</h4>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        The app allows to create profiles. Each profile contains a <em>Medical Notes</em> section. In this section, you can write the first letters of one of your device contacts. When such action is done, a pop-up appears to select the right contact. On selection, a link is automatically created. This way, when the profile is displayed from the lock screen, anybody can tap the link to open the profile associated to the contact you have defined and call him without unlocking your device.
